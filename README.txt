Here are some of the assignments or tasks I completed while completing my undergrad in Computer Science at the University of the West Indies St Augustine (and at my Winter Semester at the Concordia University in Montreal). 

Fun Fact: The equilavent course to UWI's Object Oriented Programming 1 course at Concordia was Object Oriented Programming 2. Then, when I returned to UWI I had to do a more advanced Object Oriented Programming course. So it seems as if I did the same course twice. 
This repo was created for practise.
